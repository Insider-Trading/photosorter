# Photo Sorting Application

A simple application that allows users to sort photos into directories using a user-friendly interface. I built this for sorting photos for LoRA creation.

## Features

- Load photos from a selected directory.
- View photos one at a time.
- Sort photos into predefined directories using buttons or custom hotkeys.
- Navigate between photos using the left and right arrow keys.
- Undo the last sorting action.
- Modern and minimalistic UI with rounded buttons and Segoe UI font.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `tkinter` (usually included with Python)
  - `Pillow` (for image handling)
